# patternmaker

An IDA script to aid in creating patterns for functions.

Once analysis of your binary is done, simply select the relevant snippet of byte code, then press CTRL-F12.

The plugin will give you a pattern which will uniquely identify your function.

Note: It may not always be possible to uniquely identify a function, especially short ones.
